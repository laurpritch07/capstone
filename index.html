                I think most designers today are aware of the importance of making design accessible.
However, it can be difficult to know where to start.  When I started looking for guidance, I was overwhelmed by the amount of information on the internet and even more overwhelmed by the conflicting information I found when talking to other designers and developers on projects.  I would present ideas without feeling confident that I understood the accessibility guidance.  I craved a more holistic approach to designing accessibly - one based on iteration, testing and refinement. A process that considered accessibility from the beginning.

Part visual exploration, part case study, Accessibly serves as a learning and inspiration resource for those working in graphic and web design. 

Design explorations will be centered around a case study website that will offer context for design decisions .... (need to be more clear about the part of the case study site)

This project is a way for me to develop my own knowledge of accessibility and create a reference tool for me to use in the future for my own work. However, I feel it will also be beneficial to both designers and communicators interested in learning more about creating accessible online experiences.
